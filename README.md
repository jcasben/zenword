# ðŸª´ ZenWord

ZenWord is a clone of the famous original game where you have to guess a certain number of
words given the letters of the longest one. It is called "zenword" because it has been with the
intention of inducing some kind of "relaxation" using zen backgrounds and smooth colors.

This project was developed for the final project of the course Algorithms and Data Structures II 
using Android Studio and with the collaboration of [Marc Link](https://github.com/linkcla).
